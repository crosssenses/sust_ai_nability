## About sustAInability

Sustainability and digitization are at the center of scientific and political debates as the two significant social transformations of our time. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly coming into focus, permeating more and more areas of public and private life and increasingly becoming part of sustainability debates. On the one hand, AI-supported technologies are creating a wide range of opportunities for sustainability, for example in the field of energy transition or agriculture. On the other hand, AI also poses many risks and challenges for the environment and society: Examples reach from the high energy consumption and carbon footprint of machine learning systems, to automated discrimination.

## Team and Partner

sustAInability is a so-called digitalization lab and funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Arts and coordinated by the Bavarian Research Institute for Digital Transformation (bidt).
